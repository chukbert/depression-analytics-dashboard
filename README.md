# Understanding the Causes of Depression in Rurales Zones

## Introduction
Welcome to the "Understanding the Causes of Depression" project. Depression is a complex mental health condition, and its causes can vary widely from person to person. 
In this project, we aim to delve into the factors that most significantly influence an individual's likelihood of experiencing depression. Through the application of 
various machine learning models on provided datasets, we seek to uncover patterns based on the available features. The output of our model training will highlight 
the features that have the greatest impact on depression, shedding light on potential causes.

## Project Overview
Depression is a major public health concern, affecting millions of individuals worldwide. Identifying the key factors contributing 
to depression can greatly enhance our understanding of this condition. We harness the power of several machine-learning models to explore the factors behind depression. 
The models employed in this project include:
- XGBoost
- LightGBM
- K-Nearest Neighbors (KNeighbor)
- Logistic Regression
#### Hyperparameter Tuning using Optuna
To ensure that our machine learning models perform optimally, we utilize Optuna for hyperparameter tuning. 
Optuna allows us to fine-tune the models, optimizing their performance and enhancing their predictive accuracy.

## Conclusion
Understanding the causes of depression is a multifaceted endeavor, and this project represents a crucial step toward shedding light on this intricate issue. 
By identifying the factors that most strongly influence depression, we can advance our knowledge and ultimately work towards more effective prevention and support strategies. 
Thank you for your interest in our research.
